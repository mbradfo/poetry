They call me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rrumba beat
When I play the maracas they go chick chicky boom, chick chiky boom.

Yes sir I'm Cuban Pete, I'm the craze of my native street. 
When I start to dance everything goes 
Chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom 

The senoritas they sing and they swing with their sombreros,
It's very nice, so full of spice.
And when they dance in they bring a happy ring,
El maraquero singin' a song, all the day long.
